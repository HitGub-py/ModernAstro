    "- **1.1 Stellar Parallax** \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Trigonometric parallax**: measurement of angular displacement of an object from two different vantage points creating a known baseline distance $B$ between observers. $d = B/tan(p)$. $tan(p)$ comes from small angle approximations, so we can use $p\"$ (\" standing for arcseconds) for angle values smaller than $1$ arcsecond.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The angles at which these stars move relative to the much more distant stars in the background are very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $3600$ arcseconds per $1$ degree because of $1/60/60 = 1/3600$. You have $360$ degrees of sky, split $1$ of those degrees into $60$ pieces, giving you $60$ arcminutes. Then you take $1$ of those arcminutes and split that into $60$ pieces, giving you $60$ arcseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Arcseconds are very small amounts of angle, and can be divided further for smaller movements across the night sky. Example: Proxima Centauri has a parallax angle of less than $1\"$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We measure stellar distances in units of parsecs (**par**allax-**sec**onds), 206,265 AU per parsec (great distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - First successful measurement of stellar parallax in 1838 by **Fredrich Bessel** (1784-1846).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $1 pc = 3.2615638 ly$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Objects with small parallax angles have interfering conditions such as geologic tremors or atmospheric turbulence which make it hard to find accurate angles. Space missions such as Hipparcos don't have this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1.2 The Magnitude Scale** \n",
    "    - **1.2.1 Apparent Magnitude**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Hipparchus** compiled a list of ~850 stars (some found by Persians before, he just added to the list and listed previously known ones) and compared their brightness. Later examinations of his scale showed that it was logarithmic because the human eye perceives the brightness of objects logarithmically.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Example: if a bright light source were $6$ times brighter than another, the human eye will determine the brighter object as approximately twice the brightness of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        - This means that the difference in brightness between two different magnitude stars is $100^{(m2-m1)/5}= ΔB$. Two stars separated by $1$ magnitude have a difference in brightness of $2.512$ times, or $100^{1/5}$. Two stars separated by 5 magnitudes have $100$ times difference in brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **1.2.2 Flux, Luminosity, and the Inverse Square Law**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Radiant flux $F$** is the brightness of a star measured by the total amount of radiation at all wavelengths that cross a unit of area per unit time. Definition depends on the energy emitted per second at the stellar surface (intrinsic luminosity $L$)\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Luminosity $L$ is distributed uniformly across the surface area of a shell of radius $r$ surrounding a star.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - This is the well-known inverse square law for light. The $4π$ factor is not necessarily needed as the radiant flux of some stars are given relative to the Solar Luminosity (L_sol) and the Earth-Sun distance (r_earth).\n",
    "\n",
    "        - $F = L/4πr^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **1.2.3 Flux Ratios and Apparent Magnitude**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Absolute magnitude M** of a star is the apparent magnitude a star would have if it were located at a distance of $10 pc$. We can find the ratio of their flux to be, ${\\frac{F_2}{F_1}} = 100^{m_1-m_2/5}$\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Logarithm of both sides of the flux ratio above gives an alternative form: $m_1-m_2 = -2.5log_{10}{\\frac{F_2}{F_1}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **1.2.4 Absolute Magnitude and the Distance Modulus**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Distance modulus**: $m-M = 5log_{10}(d)-5 = 5log_{10}{\\frac{d}{10 parsecs}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "        - How bright a star would be if it were $10 pc$ away is called the absolute magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Multiply the $10$ over from $d/10 pc = 10^{(m-M)/5}$ and that gives you the +5 being added to the two magnitudes in the exponent\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Goes from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-7}$ because the $d/10$ you are just dividing by $10^{1}$ to make a more negative exponent.\n",

    "\n",
    "        - He used Kepler's original third law without universal gravitation. It wasn't until 1761 until we found out the distance of an AU, so that also hampered the mathematics needed to calculate the speed of light.\n",

    "\n",
    "        - Thomas Young's double-slit experiment: two waves of light interfering with each other going through the slits. **Destructive interference** occurs when the peaks and troughs of the light wave cancel eachother, making darker parts on the screen. **Constructive interference** occurs when there are brighter fringes.\n",

    "    - **1.3.4 The Poynting Vector and Radiation Pressure**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - EM waves carry both energy and momentum in the direction of propagation. The rate at which energy is carried by a light wave is described by the Poynting vector.\n",

    "        - $S=\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}ExB$\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The Poynting vector is reliant on the cross product of the electric and magnetic field components of the EM wave. The units are in watts per meter squared $W m^{-2}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 5.4.1 The Emission Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Interested in the net flow of energy, not the specific path. The intensity can be increased through emission. This change is $ dI_{\\lambda} $ is proprtional to the the distance $ ds $ and the density of the gas $ \\rho $.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ dI_{\\lambda} = j_{\\lambda} \\rho ds ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "here, $ j_{\\lambda} $ is the **emission coefficient**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The specific intensity $ I_{\\lambda} $, changes as the photons are added. Combining the equations of absoption and emission gives the general result;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_{\\lambda} = -\\kappa_{\\lambda} \\rho I_{\\lambda} ds + j_{\\lambda} \\rho ds $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.4.2 The Source Function and the Transfer Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the ratio of emission to absorption ( $ j_{\\lambda} / \\kappa_{\\lambda} $ ), we cal this the **source function** $ S_{\\lambda} $ and looks like;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ -\\frac{1}{\\kappa_{\\lambda} \\rho} \\frac{dI_{\\lambda}}{ds} = I_{\\lambda} - \\frac{j_{\\lambda}}{\\kappa_{\\lambda}} = I_{\\lambda} - S_{\\lambda} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ I_{\\lambda} > S_{\\lambda} $ then the intensity decreases with distance. If $ I_{\\lambda} < S_{\\lambda} $, then the intensity increases with distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.4.3 The Special Case of Blackbody Radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "For a blackbody, the intensity is equal to the Planck function ( $ I_{\\lambda} = B_{\\lambda} = S_{\\lambda} $ ) [for something in thermodynamic equalibrium which stars are not in!]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applying the transfer equation**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I_{\\lambda}(s) = I_{\\lambda,o} e^{-\\kappa_{\\lambda} \\rho ds} + S_{\\lambda} ( 1 - e^{-\\kappa_{\\lambda} \\rho ds} ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.4.4 The Assumption of a Plane-Parallel Atmosphere\n",
    "\n",
    "Rewrite the transfer equation as a function of optical depth;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dI_{\\lambda}}{d\\tau_{\\lambda}} = I_{\\lambda} - S_{\\lambda} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the atmosphere is not a plane (it curves) we assume a plane-parallel slab of the atmosphere and get the equation for vertical optical depth;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tau_{\\lambda,v}(z) = \\int_z^0 \\kappa_{\\lambda} \\rho dz $$\n",
    "\n",
    "A gray atmosphere is an atmosphere that has little to no wavelength dependence. The transfer equation for a gray atmosphere is;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ cos(\\theta) \\frac{dI}{d\\tau_{\\lambda}} = I - S $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.4.5 The Eddington Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at a star, we see down to a vertical optical depth of , averaged over the disk of the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5.5 The Profiles of Spectral Lines**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.5.1 Equivalent Widths\n",
    "\n",
    "Absorption spectral lines are identified on graphs of the radiant flux $ F_{\\lambda} $ as a function of the wavelength $ \\lambda $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full width half maximum** (think inverse bell curve and take the half of the lowest point on either side and make a rectangle to connect these two with the max point of the inverse bell curve.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.5.2 Proccess that Broaden Spectral Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Natural Broadening: the spectral lines cannot be sharp even for motionless, isolated atoms due to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2 \\pi c}  \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_0} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_f} \\right), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\Delta t_0 \\text{ and } \\Delta t_f $ is the lifetime of the electron in the initial state and final state respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Doppler Broadening: The wavelengths of the absorbed or emitted light are Doppler-shifted nonrelativistically according to $ \\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda = +- | v_r | / c $. The width of a Doppler broadened spectral line should be;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{2 \\lambda}{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k T}{m}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pressure (and Collisional) Broadening: the atomic orbitals are perturbed by a collision with a neutral atom or a close encounter with the electric field of an ion. Statistical is pressure, individual collisions is collisional. To determin collisional pressue, we need to determine the average time between collisions $ \\Delta t_0 $, and the mean free path $ \\ell $. These are related through the following equation;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta t_0 = \\frac{\\ell}{v} = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma} \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2 k T}}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ m $ is the atom mass, $ \\sigma $ is the collisional cross-section, and $ n $ is the number of atoms. From the collisional pressure, we can determine the spectral line width broadening to be;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi c \\Delta t_0} \\approx \\frac{\\lambda^2 n \\sigma}{\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k T}{m}}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral line width is proportional to $ n $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.5.3 The Voigt Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "The total line profile is called the **Voigt profile** and is due to the contributions of the Doppler and the damping things. Doppler contributes more for the center wavelengths whereas the damping profile is more towards the wings of the curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine $ N_0 $, which is the coloumn density.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.5.4 The Curve of Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps determine the value of $ N_a $ (the number of atoms that have electrons in the proper orbital for absorbtion) and the abundance of elements in stellar atmospheres. The width **W** varies with $ N_a $ and therefore a log curve can be used to estimate the change in both quantities. Using the curve of growth, and a determined width, we can determine the number of absorbing atoms.\n"
